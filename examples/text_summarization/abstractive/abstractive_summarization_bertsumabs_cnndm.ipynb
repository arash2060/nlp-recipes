    "This notebook demonstrates how to fine tune BERT for abstractive text summarization. Utility functions and classes in the NLP Best Practices repo are used to facilitate data preprocessing, model training, model scoring, result postprocessing, and model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstractive Summarization\n",
    "Abstractive summarization is the task of taking an input text and summarizing its content in a shorter output text. In contrast to extractive summarization, abstractive summarization doesn't take sentences directly from the input text, instead, rephrases the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BertSumAbs\n",
    "\n",
    "BertSumAbs refers to an BERT-based abstractive summarization algorithm  in [Text Summarization with Pretrained Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08345) with [published examples](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm). It uses the pretrained BERT model as encoder and finetune both encoder and decoder on a specific labeled summarization dataset like [CNN/DM dataset](https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-summary). \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the comparison of architecture of the original BERT model (left) and BERTSUM (right), which BertSumAbs is built upon. For BERTSUM, a input document is split into sentences, and [CLS] and [SEP] tokens are inserted before and after each sentence. This resulting sequence is followed by the summation of three kinds of embeddings for each token before feeding into the transformer layers. The positional embedding used in BertSumAbs enables input length of more than 512, which is the  maximum input length for BERT model. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the architecture only shows the encoder part. For decoder, BertSumAbs also uses a transformer with multiple layers and random initialization. As pretrained weights are used in the encoder, there is a mismatch in encoder and decoder which may result in unstable finetuning. Therefore, in fine tuning, BertSumAbs uses seperate optimizers for encoder and decoder, each uses its own scheduling. In text generation, techniques like trigram blocking and beam search can be used to improve model accuracy.\n",

    "It's recommended to run this notebook on GPU machines as it's very computationally intensive. Set QUICK_RUN = True to run the notebook on a small subset of data and a smaller number of steps. If QUICK_RUN = False, the notebook takes about 5 hours to run on a VM with 4 16GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Finetuning costs around 1.5 hours and inferecing costs around 3.5 hour.  Better performance can be achieved by increasing the MAX_STEPS.\n",

    "* **Distributed Training**:\n",
    "Please note that the jupyter notebook only allows to use pytorch [DataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#dataparallel). Faster speed and larger batch size can be achieved with pytorch [DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/ddp.html)(DDP). Script [abstractive_summarization_bertsum_cnndm_distributed_train.py](./abstractive_summarization_bertsum_cnndm_distributed_train.py) shows an example of how to use DDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mixed Precision Training**:\n",
    "Please note that by default this notebook doesn't use mixed precision training. Faster speed and larger batch size can be achieved when you set FP16 to True. Refer to  https://nvidia.github.io/apex and https://github.com/nvidia/apex) for details to use mixed precision training. Check the GPU model on your machine to see if it allows mixed precision training. Please also note that mixed precision inferencing is also enabled in the prediciton utility function. When you use mixed precision training and/or inferencing, the model performance can be slightly worse than the full precision mode."
